Description: My attempts/research into the Halite challenges (2 & 3 in particular) and apply different machine learning techniques to maximize my score.


### Notes:

 - Halite code source is from the [HaliteChallenge GitHub](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge) which contains repos for all of the Halite challenges from TwoSigma.
 - My implementations will be in Python 3.
